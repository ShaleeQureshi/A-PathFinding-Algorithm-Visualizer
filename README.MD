# A* PathFinding Algorithm with a Visualizer

# How to run this program:
Go to the directory of the main.py file and in your terminal or command prompt type: python main.py
To run the executable file simply double click on it!

# How it works:
The algorithm determines the most efficient path between a start and end node. Works by making a lowest-cost path tree from the start node to the end node. Unlike Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* uses a heuristic function as a guiding mechanism to determine the region of space that can compute the shortest path.
